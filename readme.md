This choropleth map shows the average Dynamic Object Team Rating System (DOTS) score among all female drug-tested raw lifters who competed in a sanctioned powerlifting competition between 1985 and 2023. The DOTS coefficient was implemented in 2019 as a way to compare powerlifting performances across gender and weight class. DOTS are used in powerlifting meets to determing Best Lifter awards. A higher DOTS score indicates a greater strength per lb of bodyweight.

This webmap is structured using HTML. CSS is used within the <*style*> tags to structure the size, color, alignment, and other features of the text included in the map. JavaScript is used within the <*script*> tags to create and structure elements of my webmap, including the basemap and data in GeoJSON format. I also used JavaScript to add map interaction elements including highlighting and displaying data based on where the cursor is located on the web map. 


## <span style="color:indigo">Data & Libraries</span>
